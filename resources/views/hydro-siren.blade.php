    Hydro siren system
Siren or alerting system is one of the essential features for hydropower in order to alert nearby people and/or settlement. When the gates of the dam opened, the river level would suddenly rise and represent very sudden danger. It is necessary to warn people at the time of dam opening. For that every dam needs a foolproof warning system to alert downstream habitats before release of water from the dam spillways.

Warning and or alert system comparison more than 2 sirens which need to be installed several kilometers away from the dam's vulnerable points where people are fishing, collecting water, washing clothes or where there are settlements/villages close to the river bank which would be exposed to the risk of water surge.
